We are a collective of students, trying to evolve in our respective fields in 
a world that is more visual than ever. Sometimes, **TEXT** does not cut it anymore. We 
are here to help anyone who is interested in the art and science of data visualization, 
and be helped to improve our work. 

**Special Thanks To:**

We would like to give credit for the design of the logo on our business cards, flyers and 
the website to Katie Ganious. And also give credit for the above logo to Hillary Collura. 
Thanks for your creativity.
