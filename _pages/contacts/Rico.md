Ricardo (Rico) Palafox is a junior undergraduate student double majoring in Psychology and Mathematics with a concentration in Probability and Statistics and a minor in Computer Science. His early exposure to statistics in the social sciences sparked an interest for the power of data but the exposure to actuarial sciences during his time as an insurance professional cemented the desire to pursue a career in data analytics. Rico has participated in various academic programs on campus including McNair Scholars, Big Data Discovery & Diversity through Research Education Advancement and Partnership (BD3-REAP), and Graduate Readiness and Access in Mathematics (GRAM) which have expanded his statistical and mathematical knowledge. He hopes his participation in Data Visualization Club will allow him to connect with fellow scholars across disciplines to support each otherâ€™s statistical software skill development. Rico currently resides in Fullerton, CA.
